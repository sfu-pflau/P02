suggestion list
faking the login/sign in button
	chanage the sign in button so it react differently when user "logged in", best bet is to look into js
the order in order list dont look clickable, maybe make a button
	current in my account there is a list of ordered item, for some visual reason most people dont think it's clickable, and they are looking for a button
bottom of landing page used a 3colum and 4colum grid and somewhat confusing
	it could be the issus with not having content in it
and landing page need to have more things, it's too empty, maybe put product there
	people want to see some example products for the website.
there is currently no link to get to all product
